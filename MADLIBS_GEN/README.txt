"50 Short Story" Project

Overview

The "50 Short Story" project is a Python program that allows users to interactively complete short stories by providing replacement words for predefined placeholders within the story text. This program enhances user engagement by enabling them to contribute their creativity to the storytelling process.

How It Works

1. **Story Selection**: Users are presented with a list of 50 short stories stored in a text file named "50story.txt." They can choose a story by entering the corresponding story number.

2. **Placeholder Identification**: Each short story contains placeholders marked by angle brackets ("<" and ">"). These placeholders represent words or phrases within the story that users are required to replace.

3. **User Input**: The program prompts users to provide replacement words or phrases for each placeholder within the chosen story.

4. **Placeholder Substitution**: The program replaces the placeholders in the story text with the user-provided words or phrases, creating a personalized version of the story.

5. **Display Completed Story**: The completed story, with placeholders replaced, is displayed to the user, allowing them to enjoy their custom version of the narrative.

Usage Instructions

1. Run the Python script (`50story.py`) to initiate the program.

2. Select a story by entering the corresponding story number when prompted.

3. Follow the prompts to provide replacement words or phrases for each placeholder within the story.

4. Once all placeholders are replaced, the completed story will be displayed.

Example

Here's an example of a completed story:

Original Story:
```
Once upon a <time_of_day>, in a <location> far away, there lived a <character>.
```

User Input:
```
<time_of_day> : "sunny afternoon"
<location> : "enchanted forest"
<character> : "friendly unicorn"
```

Completed Story:
```
Once upon a sunny afternoon, in an enchanted forest far away, there lived a friendly unicorn.
```

Note

- The program validates user input to ensure it's a valid integer and provides clear instructions throughout the process.
- The "50tory.txt" file should be present in the same directory as the Python script for the program to work correctly.
